    "If you recall back to the article, we talked a bit about image classification. Now we're going to take a peek behind the curtain and see how this magic really happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, most image classification tasks are completed by something called a CNN. This stands for Convolutional Neural Network...it's quite the mouthful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand a CNN model, we're going to have to talk about something called a 'neural network'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network will look at an image and try to break it down into recognizable pieces or features. For example, if we look at the image below, it will search the image pixel by pixel for any pink, pig-shaped objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "The neural network will repeat this process until it is confident that there is in fact a pink pig in the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information is passed through 'neurons'. Each neuron will carry information on a pixel (a small chunk of the image) and pass it on to another neuron which will use this information to predict that a pink pig is present in the image.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This image shows us a representation of what a neural network looks like. It looks super complicated, but it's basically a bunch of neurons passing information to each other to classify an image. This is a little insight into what's going on behind the scenes of the code you're running.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay with me here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know more about neural networks, but we still need to talk about the 'convolutional' part. As this is a bit of a tricky concept, we're going to try to simplify this as much as possible. So, if you would like to go into further depth, you can read this <a href=\"https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/\"> article</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the convolutional part of the neural network computes a bunch of maths on the pixels in an image to explain how all the pixels in the image link together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum a CNN up, it's an algorithm that takes an image as an input and learns 'all on its own' how to identify the object in the image. Magic!\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, we got there. Congratulations if you made it through this.\n",
